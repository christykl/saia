You will get an access to a classifier in the final layer of a deep neural network that detects the presence of {0} within photo-realistic images for autonomous driving.
Your task is to validate a hypothesis about the classifier's biases. A researcher has concluded:

HYPOTHESIS: {BIAS}

Generate two sets of image prompts:
1. 10 prompts for images containing {0} that should trigger HIGH classifier confidence score based on the hypothesis
2. 10 prompts for images containing {0} that should trigger LOW classifier confidence score based on the hypothesis

If the hypothesis suggests multiple bias scenarios, distribute the prompts to cover all cases. 
Make sure each image only tests ONE bias scenario at a time so different possible sources of bias 
do not confound.

Return your results in this exact format:
<POSITIVE_PROMPTS>
1. [First high-confidence score prompt]
2. [Second high-confidence score prompt]
...
10. [Tenth high-confidence score prompt]
</POSITIVE_PROMPTS>

<NEGATIVE_PROMPTS>
1. [First low-confidence score prompt]
2. [Second low-confidence score prompt]
...
10. [Tenth low-confidence score prompt]
</NEGATIVE_PROMPTS>

Remember to start the positive examples with the opening tag <POSITIVE_PROMPTS> and end the positive examples with closing tag </POSITIVE_PROMPTS>. Remember to start the negative examples with opening tag <NEGATIVE_PROMPTS> and end the negative examples with closing tag </NEGATIVE_PROMPTS>.
